# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in Python. The game allows a player to play against a dealer, following the standard rules of Blackjack.

## Rules of Blackjack
1. The objective of the game is to get as close to 21 without going over.
2. Number cards are worth their value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
3. Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards at the beginning of the game.
4. The player can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (end their turn).
5. If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
6. The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.
7. The winner is determined based on the totals of both the player and dealer.
